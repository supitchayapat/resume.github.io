1. Make sure you have what you need
To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can get it HERE
2. Build a Create-React-App
Next, you will build the initial application using a handy tool called Create-React-App. This allows you to get up and running with a React app without the headache of setting up build-tool configurations. Go HERE to get started. When the app building is finished run cd yourappname and run npm start to test it out. Hit ctrl+c in the terminal when you want to stop the server that the above command starts. For this project we will also need to install JQuery and ReactGA, do this by running npm install jquery --save and npm install react-ga --save in your terminal while inside your project folder. YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS.
3. Enjoy  Resume Website
When you're all done, run npm start again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
